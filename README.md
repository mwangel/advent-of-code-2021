My own solutions for Advent of Code 2021

I do this for fun and self-improvement and 
I have no chance on the global leaderboard 
but we will see how I do on the SweClockers Leaderboard: 115994-59705230

Maybe this will link there for you too or maybe you have 
to be logged in, who knows.

By the way, if anyone is reading this, you can do whatever you want with the code.
Even claim it as your own if you want to. It's up to you.

Merry Christmas
